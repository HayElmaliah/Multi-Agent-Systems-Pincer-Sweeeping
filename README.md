# Pincer Movement Simulation

This project simulates the pincer movement of agents trying to detect evaders within a circular region.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries: `numpy` and `matplotlib`.
2. Navigate to the `pincer_simulation` directory in your terminal or command prompt.
3. Run the command: `python main.py`.
4. Use the GUI to input the number of agents and the radius of the circle, then start the simulation.
