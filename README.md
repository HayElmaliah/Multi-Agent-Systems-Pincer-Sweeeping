# Pincer Movement Simulation

This project simulates the pincer movement of agents trying to detect evaders within a circular region.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries: `numpy` and `matplotlib`.
2. Run the command: `python main.py`.
3. Use the GUI to input the number of agents and the sensor's length (defaultly chosen), then choose the type of pincer search you would like to run (circular vs. spiral) and then start the simulation.
